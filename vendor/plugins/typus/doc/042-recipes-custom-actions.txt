=== Custom Actions ===

You can overwrite and extend Admin::ResourcesController with your 
methods. Actions are defined in <tt>config/typus/application.yml</tt>:

----
Post:
  ...
  actions:
    index: custom_action
    edit: custom_action_for_an_item
----

Remember to define permissions on <tt>config/typus/application_roles.yml</tt> 
to have access to the new actions.

----
admin:
  Post: all

editor:
  Post: create, read, update, custom_action_for_an_item
----

Your controller will look like this ...

----
class Admin::PostsController < Admin::ResourcesController

  def custom_action
    ...
  end

  def custom_action_for_an_item
    ...
  end

end
----
